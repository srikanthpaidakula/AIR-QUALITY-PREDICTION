# AIR-QUALITY-PREDICTION
This project classifies air quality using PM2.5 data with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN models. Data was preprocessed, categorized, and visualized. Decision Tree achieved the best accuracy, while SVM excelled in performance but requires more computational resources.
